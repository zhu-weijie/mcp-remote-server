#### **Implement and Test Core MCP Business Logic**

*   **Problem:** The service is a functional "walking skeleton"â€”it can be configured, logged, tested, and deployed, but it performs no useful work. It does not yet satisfy the primary functional requirements of the PRD, which are to provide `echo` and `math` functionalities.

*   **Solution:**
    1.  Create two new, distinct Python modules (`echo_server.py`, `math_server.py`) to contain the business logic, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.
    2.  Implement the `echo` and `add_two` functions within these modules.
    3.  In the main FastAPI application, mount these modules as MCP tools, exposing them at the `/echo/mcp/` and `/math/mcp/` endpoints.
    4.  Add specific **unit tests** to the existing `Test Suite` that directly validate the correctness of the `echo` and `add_two` functions in isolation.

*   **Trade-offs:**
    *   **Pros:**
        *   This feature delivers the core business value required for the MVP.
        *   The logic is implemented in a modular, decoupled fashion, making it easy to test and maintain independently of the web framework.
        *   Mandating unit tests for the business logic ensures correctness and protects against future regressions.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   This is a necessary addition of complexity to the application. There are no significant negative trade-offs, as this work is the primary goal of the project.

#### **3. Design the Architecture-as-Code (AaC)**

The following artifacts define the architectural changes for this issue.

*   **Logical View (C4 Component Diagram)**

    *This diagram zooms *inside* the `FastAPI Web Service` to show the new business logic components.*

        Component(test_suite, "Test Suite", "Pytest")

        System_Boundary(c2, "FastAPI Web Service") {
            Component(api_endpoints, "API Endpoints", "FastAPI", "Handles HTTP routing, request/response, and mounts MCP tools.")
            Component(echo_tool, "Echo Tool Logic", "Python Module", "Contains the 'echo' business logic.")
            Component(math_tool, "Math Tool Logic", "Python Module", "Contains the 'add_two' business logic.")
        }
    }

    Rel(api_endpoints, echo_tool, "Uses")
    Rel(api_endpoints, math_tool, "Uses")

    Rel(test_suite, api_endpoints, "Makes HTTP requests to", "Integration Tests")
    Rel(test_suite, echo_tool, "Directly invokes", "Unit Tests")
    Rel(test_suite, math_tool, "Directly invokes", "Unit Tests")
```

*   **Physical View (Deployment Diagram)**

    *   **Decision:** The Physical View for this issue is **unchanged**.
    *   **Rationale:** The new business logic is implemented as Python code that is packaged into the *exact same physical artifact* as before: a single Docker container. It does not introduce new infrastructure, processes, or physical deployment considerations. Therefore, the previously validated Physical View from Issue #1 remains the accurate source of truth, and creating a new, identical diagram would be redundant.

*   **Component-to-Resource Mapping Table**

| Logical Component | Physical Resource | Rationale (Why this choice?) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API Endpoints** | **FastAPI Application Object** | This is the core of the web service, responsible for handling the web layer. FastAPI is the chosen framework per the PRD. |
| **Echo Tool Logic** | **Python Module** | A simple, self-contained Python module is the most direct and maintainable way to implement this piece of business logic. It is lightweight, requires no external infrastructure, and is easily unit-tested. |
| **Math Tool Logic** | **Python Module** | Same as above. This modular approach ensures that as we add more tools, the complexity remains manageable and the concerns are cleanly separated. |
