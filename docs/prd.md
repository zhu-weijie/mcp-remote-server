### **Product Requirements Document: MCP Remote Server**

#### **1. Overview**

*   **Project:** MCP Remote Server
*   **Mission:** To build and deploy a scalable, production-grade web service that exposes multiple backend tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The service will be containerized for portability and deployed to AWS, following a strict Issue-Driven Development (IDD) workflow.

#### **2. Core Features (Functional Requirements)**

*   **Echo Tool:**
    *   **Endpoint:** `/echo/mcp/`
    *   **Functionality:** A tool that accepts a `message: str` and returns it verbatim.
*   **Math Tool:**
    *   **Endpoint:** `/math/mcp/`
    *   **Functionality:** A tool that accepts an `n: int` and returns `n * 2`.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** The FastAPI application must be structured to allow for the easy addition of new, independent MCP tools as separate modules in the future.

#### **3. Stakeholders & Use Cases**

*   **As a Client Application Developer (End-User),** I need stable, documented MCP endpoints so I can reliably integrate the echo and math functionalities into my application.
*   **As a Service Developer (Our Team),** I need a clear, automated process for testing and deploying new tools so I can extend the service's functionality efficiently and safely.
*   **As an Operator/SRE,** I need robust logging, health checks, and automated deployment so I can maintain service stability and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### **4. Technical & Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Language:** Python 3.12.11
    *   **Framework:** FastAPI
    *   **Dependency Management:** `pyproject.toml` managed by `uv`.
*   **Deployment:**
    *   **Artifact:** The application must be packaged as a Docker container.
    *   **Target:** The container will be deployed to a managed AWS service (e.g., AWS App Runner, ECS Fargate).
*   **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions):**
    *   **Trigger:** On merge/push to the `main` branch.
    *   **Stages:**
        1.  Lint and format checks.
        2.  Run automated tests (unit/integration).
        3.  Build and tag Docker image.
        4.  Push image to a container registry (e.g., Amazon ECR).
        5.  Trigger deployment on AWS.
*   **Observability & Reliability:**
    *   **Logging:** All application logs must be structured (JSON format) and output to `stdout` for collection by the hosting service (e.g., AWS CloudWatch).
    *   **Health Check Endpoint:** A standard HTTP endpoint at `/health` must be implemented, returning a `200 OK` status with a simple JSON body (e.g., `{"status": "ok"}`).
    *   **Configuration:** All environment-specific configurations (e.g., API keys, port) must be supplied via environment variables.

#### **5. Development Process**

*   **Methodology:** Issue-Driven Development (IDD).
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  No work begins without a corresponding GitHub Issue.
    2.  All code changes must be submitted via a Pull Request (PR) from a feature branch.
    3.  The PR description must link to the issue it resolves (e.g., `Closes #issue-number`).
    4.  All PRs must pass automated checks (CI) before being eligible for review and merging.

#### **6. Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)**

*   The `Echo` and `Math` tools are deployed to AWS and are fully functional.
*   The CI/CD pipeline automates deployment successfully from a PR merge to a live environment update.
*   The service includes a `/health` endpoint that is monitored for uptime.
*   Structured logs for requests and errors are visible in AWS CloudWatch.
*   The project `README.md` provides clear, validated instructions for local setup (using Docker) and environment variable configuration.
